# Hands-on EC2 : Working with EC2 Snapshots and AMI

Purpose of the this hands-on training is to teach students how to take a snapshot of EC2 instance, create an image from EC2 instance and using Data Lifecycle Manager. 

## Learning Outcomes

- At the end of the this hands-on training, students will be able to;

- take snapshots of EC2 instances on AWS console.

- create images from EC2 instances on AWS console.

- understand of difference between the image and the snapshot.

- create different types of AMI.

- using the Data Lifecycle Manager 

- coping and sharing AMI

## Outline

Part 1 - Creating an Image from the Snapshot of the Nginx Server and Launching a new Instance

Part 2 - Creating an Image and Launching an Instance from the same Image

Part 3 - Creating an Image from the Snapshot of the Root Volume and Launching a new Instance

Part 4 - Make AMI Public

Part 5 - Create Wordpress with AMI (Bitnami)

Part 6 - Using Data Lifecycle Manager 

## Part 1 - Creating an Image from the Snapshot of the Nginx Server and Launching a new Instance

- Launch an instance with following configurations.

  a. Security Group: Allow SSH and HTTP ports from anywhere with named "SSH and HTTP"

  b. User data (paste user data seen below for Nginx)

```bash
#! /bin/bash
dnf update -y
dnf install nginx -y
dnf install git -y
systemctl start nginx
cd /usr/share/nginx/html
git clone https://github.com/techproedu/designer.git
chmod -R 777 /usr/share/nginx/html
rm index.html
cp -R ./designer/. .
systemctl restart nginx
systemctl enable nginx
```

  c. Tag: Since "Data Lifecycle Manager" work based on tags, we use tag to customize Instance!!!!!!!! 

  ```text
  Key: Name 
  Value: SampleInstance  
  ```

  d.  Click `launch instance` button.  

  e. Copy the public IP of the newly created instance and paste it to the browser. Show that the Nginx Web Server is working.


- First copy the Instance ID and then go to EC2 dashboard and click "Snapshot" section from left-hand menu.


- Click `create snapshot` button.

Select resource type : Instance
Instance ID          : Select the instance ID of Nginx
Tag: 
  Key: Name 
  Value: Instance-Snapshot-First  

- Click create snapshot.

- Click snapshot `Action` menu and select `create image from snapshot`

```text
Name        : techproAMI_1
Description : techproAMI_1
```
- Click the `create image` button.

- Click the `launch instance` tab.

- Launch instance named `Instance_1_from_Sample_Instance`

- Click `myAMI` from left-hand menu.

- Select `techproAMI_1` AS AMI

- Copy the public IP of the newly created instance and paste it to the browser.

- Show that the Nginx Web Server is working.

## Part 2 - Creating an Image and Launching an Instance from the same Image with "Action Menu"

- Go to `SampleInstance`

- Click the `actions` menu.

- Select `image and templates` >> `create image`.

```text
Name        : techproAMI_2
Description : techproAMI_2
```
- Click the `create image` button.

- Click AMI section from left hand menu and show `techproAMI_2`

- After `techproAMI_2` creation process is completed, click snapshot section from left-hand menu.

-  Show that AWS has created a new snapshot for newly created `techproAMI_2` image.

- Check the "Snapshot Menu" if there is an extra snapshot or not. If yes, then  name it. Explain the reason.

```text
Name : Snapshot_Second_Auto 
```

-  Click the `launch instance` tab.

- Click `myAMI` from left-hand menu.

- Select `techproAMI_2`.

- Security Group: Allow SSH and HTTP ports from anywhere named "SSH and HTTP"

- Launch instance as named `Instance_2_from_Sample_Instance`

- Copy the public IP of the newly created instance and paste it to the browser.

- Show that the Nginx Web Server is working.


## Part 3 - Creating an Image from the Snapshot of the Root Volume and Launching a new Instance

- Go to EC2 menu and click snapshot section from left-hand menu.

- Click `create snapshot` button.
```text
Select resource type : ****Volume
Instance ID : select the root volume of the SampleInstance
Name(manually)       : Snapshot_Third 
```

- Go to the `Action` menu and click `create image from snapshot`.

```text
Name        : techproAMI_3
Description : techproAMI_3
```

- Complete the process by saying `create image`.

- Click `AMIs` from left-hand menu.

- Select `techproAMI_3`.

- Click the `launch instance from AMI` tab.

- Launch instance as named `Instance_3_from_Sample_Instance`

- Security Group: Allow SSH and HTTP ports from anywhere named "SSH and HTTP"

- Copy the public IP of the newly created instance and paste it to the browser.

- Show that the Nginx Web Server is working.

## Part 4 - Make AMI public.

- First go to the AMIs section  from left-hand menu and say students to not to do together.

- Select the  `TechproAMI_3`

- Click `Edit AMI permissions` from the `Actions` menu.

- Select `AMI availability` -----> `Public` and click `Save Changes`.

- It will be public after a while. Share the AMI ID.

- Tell the student to go to Instance-----> Launch Instance------> Choose AMI------> Community AMI and paste the "AMI ID" in the search bar.

- Delete all AMIs and Snapshots. (We first derigester AMIs and then delete snapshots)

*** In order to make it public, click settings at the bottom of the EC2 Dashboard, select Block public access for AMIs in the protection and security tab on the page that opens, select manage and remove the public block.
- Account attributes----->  Data protection and security----->  Block public access for AMIs----->Manage----->Block new public sharing(unchecked)

## Part 5 - Hosting WordPress on EC2 with AMI

- Create EC2 instnace
  - AMI: AWS Marketplace  : "WordPress Certified by Bitnami and Automattic" (Free tier)(ami-047738b584476b2fe
)
  - Instance type         : t2.micro
  - Volume                : 10Gb is default.***
  - Tag                   : Key=Name, Value= WordPress
  - Sec.Grp               : HTTP & HTTPS & SSH are default ***
  - 
- Go to the browser and paste WP IP .

- to customize the page >>>>> after the IP add "/wp-admin"
- In the opening page you need a user name and password for customizing WP
- Select the wordpress Instance from console
   - Action  >>>  Monitor and Troubleshoot >>>>>> Get System logs >>>> "user name and password" 
- Go to browser and log in with credentials. 
- Delete the WP instance. 

## Part 6 - Using Data Lifecycle Manager :

- In the Amazon EC2 Console, under Elastic Block Store-->Lifecycle Manager-->Create new lifecycle policy.

- You can select the policy type depending on your target component to snapshot. 

```text
Policy type: EBS snapshot policy
```

- You can select the resource type as volume or instance depending on whether you want to schedule snapshots. We will be selecting "Instance" as the resource type.

Select resource type: Instance

- Enter a description:

```text
Description: "Test policy"
```
- Now select the tags associated with the EBS volumes or EC2 instance, it will depend on the option chosen above. We are  including all the instances with tag name : 


```text
  Key: Name 
  Value: SampleInstance  
```
- This policy must be associated with an IAM role that has the appropriate permissions. If you choose to create a new role, you must grant relevant role permissions and setup trust relationships correctly. If you are unsure of what role to use, choose Default role. 
```text
  Default Role 
```

- Schedules define how often the policy is triggered, and the specific actions that are to be performed. The policy must have at least one schedule. This schedule is mandatory, while schedules 2, 3, and 4 are optional.

```text
Policy Schedule 1
Schedule name : My_schedule
Frequency     : Daily
Every         : 24H
Starting at   : 03:00 UTC
Retention Type: Count 
Retain        : 5
```
- Copy the "Copy tags from source" option. Thanks to this option, tags from the source volume are automatically assigned to snapshots created by the schedule.

- Cross region copy

```text
Uncheck "Enable cross region copy"
```
- Cross-account sharing

```text
Check "Enable cross-account sharing"
```
- Confirm the Policy Summary to be sure that the rules are specified correctly, as per your requirement. Choose Enable policy to start the policy, runs at the next scheduled  time.

```text
Enable Policy
```
- Finally, choose Create Policy. 

- That's it, you're DLM policy is created. Check Ä±t from console. 

- Delete the policy.
