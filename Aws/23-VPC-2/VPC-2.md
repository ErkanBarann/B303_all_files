# Hands-on VPC-02 : Creating Bastion Host, Elastic IP, NAT Gateway, NAT Instance and connect to the private subnet from internet

## Part 1 - Creating Bastion Host and connect to the private subnet from internet

- discuss about how to connect to the "az1a-private-subnet" instance

- Explain logic of why we need Bastion Host?

- Launch two Instances. 
One is in Private Subnet-1a 
the other one is in Public Subnet-1a

- Configure Private instance.

```text
AMI             : Amazon Linux 2
Instance Type   : t2.micro
Keypair         : your key
Network         : myVPC
Subnet          : az1a-private-subnet
Security Group  : 
    Sec.Group Name : Private Sec.group
    Rules          : TCP --- > 22 ---> Anywhere
                     All ICMP IPv4  ---> Anywhere
Tag             :
    Key         : Name
    Value       : Private EC2
```


- Configure Public instance (Bastion Host).

                     HTTPs ---> 443 ---> Anywhere (Update your security group if this port is missing)
Tag             :
    Key         : Name
    Value       : Public EC2 (Bastion Host)
```

- This configuration adds an extra layer of security and can also be used.
```text
Rules        : TCP --- > 22 ---> Anywhere
                |         |         |
                |         |         |
                V         V         V
               TCP --- > 22 ---> Public Sec.Group
``` 
- Try to connect private instance via ssh
  (As you see in the dashboard there is no public IP for instance)

- show that you can't connect directly to private instance from local with ssh connection.

- Since there is no public IP of private instance, we need to connect ssh via Bastion Host instance

- to be able to coonect to the private instance via public, we need our pem file to be copied onto the public instance. 


- this method copies any file securely to the remote destination.

- **Way 1**: another way to copy pem file to remote is using vscode to drag and drop the file to the remote folder

sudo ssh -i "rahmat.pem" ec2-user@172.16.2.18

- **Way 2**: another way to copy pem file is to use vim to create pem file in /home/ec2-user directory, then copying the content of pem file on local computer into the pem file in vim editor.

sudo vim key.pem

```bash
sudo chmod 400 key.pem
sudo ssh -i "key.pem" ec2-user@172.16.2.18

```

- **Way 3**: another way to do all is using ssh agent, to do this follow on ..



- in your local terminal

- Enable ssh-agent (start the ssh-agent in the background)

eval degişkeni komut haline getirme

```bash
cd Downloads/

eval "$(ssh-agent)"
```
- Add your private key to the ssh agent on your `localhost`. `ssh-agent is a program that runs in background and stores your keys in memory`.

```bash
ssh-add ./[your pem file name]     # keypem ekle
```
- connect to the ec2 instance az1a-public-subnet instance in public subnet. 

- if we don't want to create a config file, we have another option, using -A flag with the ssh command. `-A` option `enables forwarding of the authentication agent connection`. It means that, it forwards your SSH auth schema to the remote host. So you can use SSH over there as if you were on your local machine.

```bash
ssh -A ec2-user@ec2-3-88-199-43.compute-1.amazonaws.com       # -A oteketin saglma, tm yetkili 
```
- once logged into the ec2-in-az1a-public-sn (bastion host/jump box), connect to 
the ec2-in-az1a-private-sn instance in the private subnet 
```bash
ssh ec2-user@[Your private EC2 private IP]
```
- Show connection of the private EC2 over the Bastion Host

- Try ping google.com

```bash
chmod 400 key.pem
```


## Part 2 - Creating NAT Gateway

-  discuss about how to connect to internet from the Private EC2 in private subnet 

### Step 1 : Create Elastic IP

- Go to VPC console on left hand menu and select Elastic IP tab

- Tab Allocate Elastic IP address

Elastic IP address settings

```text
Network border Group : Keep it as is (us-east-1)

Amazon's pool of IPv4 addresses
```
- Click Allocate button and name it as "First Elastic IP"

- create a NAT Gateway in the public subnet

### STEP 2: Create Nat Gateway

- Go to VPC console on left hand menu and select Nat Gateway tab

- Click Create Nat Gateway button 
```bash
Name                      : my-nat-gateway

Subnet                    : az1a-public-subnet

Elastic IP allocation ID  : First Elastic IP
```
- click "create Nat Gateway" button

### STEP 3 : Modify Route Table of Private Instance's Subnet

- Go to VPC console on left hand menu and select Route Table tab

- Select "private-rt" ---> Routes ----> Edit Rule ---> Add Route
```
Destination     : 0.0.0.0/0
Target ----> Nat Gateway ----> my-nat-gateway
```
- click save routes

- go to private instance via terminal using bastion host

- try to ping www.google.com and show response.
```bash
sudo yum update -y
curl google.com
ping yahoo.com
ping google.com
```
   
## Delete NAT Gateway and Release EIP

- Go to VPC console on left hand menu and select Nat Gateway tab

- Select my-nat-gateway --- > Actions ---> delete Nat Gateway

- Go to VPC console on left hand menu and select Elastic IP tab

- Select "First Elastic IP" ----> Actions ----> Release Elastic IP Address ----> Release 

- go to private root table and delete NAT gateway route

## Part 3 - Creating NAT Instance

- search in chrome browser for NAT Instance, go to AWS result page, review the documentation and the script code

### Create NAT Instance



 create an instance from AMIs designed as NAT.

- Go to EC2 Menu Using AWS Console

```text
AMI             : ami-037eb9e678c1a8ed9 (Nat Instance)
Instance Type   : t2.micro

    Sec.Group Name : Public Sec.group
    Rules          : TCP ---> 22  80 443 ---> Anywhere

Tag             :
    Key         : Name
    Value       : my NAT Instance
```

- Select created Nat Instance on EC2 list
  kendinin dişında trafik bırak
- Tab Actions Menu ----> Networking ----> Change Source/Destination Check ---> stop, Disable

- Explain why we need to implement this process mentioned above

### Configuring the Route Table

- Go to Route Table and select "private-rt"

- Select Routes sub-menu ----> Edit Rules ----> Delete blackhole for Nat Gateway

- Add Route
```
Destination     : 0.0.0.0/0
Target ----> Instance ----> Nat Instance
```

- Connect to private Instance via bastion host and ping www.google.com to show response.
```bash
cd Downloads/

eval "$(ssh-agent)"

```bash
ssh-add ./[your pem file name]
```


```bash
ssh -A ec2-user@ec2-3-88-199-43.compute-1.amazonaws.com
```

```bash
ssh ec2-user@[Your private EC2 private IP]
```
sudo yum install git -y
sudo yum update -y
curl google.com
ping yahoo.com
ping google.com
